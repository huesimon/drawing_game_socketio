- Multiple users
- User can pick color (red, green, or blue)



# TODO:

- Get user inputs (text), who can guess the drawing first. 
- Hint text that starts  as ("_ _ _ _ _ "), but will randomly add letters from the CORRECT word as time goes by.
- Make someone the "drawer?" so only one user can actually draw on the canvas at the time.
- more paint tools (fx fill)
